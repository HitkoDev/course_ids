# Predictive modelling - Feature selection

Key: sometimes we need to reduce number of features to even run the model; often we can run the model, but we still want to reduce the number of features to speed it up and improve interpretability of the model.

Main approaches:
- Use a method that scales (linear models),
- Dimensionality reduction via removing features or transforming feature space (already partially covered in previous summarization chapters):
 * before the model is applied (filtering)
 * together with the model (wrapper-based)
