```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

## Data

```{r}
set.seed(0)
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- rnorm(100)
```

```{r fig.width=4, fig.height=4, fig.cap = paste("Relationship between high jump and long jump performance (n =", length(x), ").")}
plot(x,y)
```

We can also use inline R core: there are `r length(y)` observations in our data.
