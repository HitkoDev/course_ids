# Docker container platform

To enable the portability and easier scalability of our applications, there is a need to provide some tools that can package together tho whole environment, needed by our applications, such as library dependencies or language runtime. 

Docker is a set of tools that use operating-system-level virtualization to develop and deliver software in packages called containers. The software that hosts the containers is called Docker Engine and was first started in 2013 by Docker, Inc. Docker producst are available both in community and enterprise editions.

Docker containers are isolated from each other and as mentioned above, they bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files. If our application consists of multiple services, a container can communicate with each other through internal or external network configuation. All containers are run by a single (host) operating-system kernel and are thus more lightweight than virtual machines. They are instantiated from Docker images that specify their precise contents. Images are often created by combining and modifying existing standard images downloaded from public repositories (i.e. image registries). An instance of an image (i.e. container) thus contains configured networking, storage, logging, etc. Furthermore, Docker defines an abstraction for these machine-specific settings and the exact same Docker container can run without any changes on many different machines, with many different configurations.

There exist also similar technologies like Docker, which may not be that well known or are used for different scenarios, such as [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/), [Nanobox](https://nanobox.io/) or [LXC](https://linuxcontainers.org/). Another approach of bundling applications into separate environment is using virtual machines, where each virtual machine contains its own whole operating system. Most known such virtualization technologies are [VMWare products](https://www.vmware.com/) or [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/). A technology in between the both Worlds is [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/), which enables a user to script the whole environment but when running the app, Vagrant creates a separate virtual machine (e.g. using Virtualbox) and runs it. 

## Why Docker?

Author of a Linux.com article [@docker] described Docker as follows:

>Docker is a tool that can package an application and its dependencies in a virtual container that can run on any Linux server. This helps enable flexibility and portability on where the application can run, whether on premises, public cloud, private cloud, bare metal, etc.

Virtual machines and containers have similar resource isolation and allocation benefits, but containers virtualize the operating system comparing to virtual machines which virtualize hardware. Therefore, containers are more portable and efficient.

Multiple containers can run on the same machine and share the OS kernel with other containers, each running as isolated processes in user space. Containers take up much less space than virtual machines (container images are typically tens of MBs in size) can handle more applications and require fewer operating systems.

Virtual machines as an abstraction of physical hardware turn one server into many servers. The hypervisor allows multiple virtual machines to run on a single machine. Each virtual machine contains a full copy of an operating system, the application, necessary binaries and libraries. All these takes GBs of data and therefore virtual machines require more disk space, physical resources and are slower to boot. The Figure below shows a comparison between multiple running Docker containers (left side) and multiple virtual machines (right side).

## Setting up the environment

To install Docker on your machine, you need to download the appropriate Docker Engine Community distribution from the official [download website](https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&offering=community). You may notice that there exist also *Docker Machine* installation package, which is a provisioning and installation software for Docker - you do not need it at this point as it helps you managing multiple remote Docker hosts.

After the installation you can explore different setting in the installation. A part of the installation is also a tool called *Kitematic*, which provides a handy GUI to overview downloaded images, containers, volumes and their settings. You can use it as a side-tool to command-line commands we introduce below.

To check your Docker installation, run `docker info` to view some status details.

```bash
Containers: 0
 Running: 0
 Paused: 0
 Stopped: 0
Images: 0
Server Version: 18.09.2
Storage Driver: overlay2
...
```

If you experience some permission problems, you need to allow your user to work with docker. Follow the [post-installation guidelines](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/).

Now we are ready to test the Docker installation by running command `docker run hello-world`. If you see a similat message to the below, you are ready to start.

```bash
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
1b930d010525: Pull complete

Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

```

## Short introduction to Docker

### Basics

A Docker container is a runtime instance of an image - that is, an image with state, or a user process. You can see a list of available images usinf the command `docker image ls`:

```bash
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
docker-app          latest              4b727c80cf90        4 minutes ago       475MB
application         latest              cd497ca7013b        19 hours ago        538MB
database            latest              428448bc5e2d        19 hours ago        373MB
ubuntu              18.04               4c108a37151f        4 weeks ago         64.2MB
mysql               5                   a1aa4f76fab9        5 weeks ago         373MB
hello-world         latest              fce289e99eb9        6 months ago        1.84kB
```
A container is launched by running an image. An image is an executable package that includes everything needed to run an application - the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files. We have seen the *docker run* command that takes image name as a parameter. Image name looks like of *[username/]repository[:tag]*, where *tag* is *latest* by default. To see all the container on your machine, issue the command `docker container ls --all` (the parameter *--all* will list also stopped containers):

```bash
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                      PORTS                    NAMES

```

### Docker application example

To better understand everything, let's develop a simple web application and run it within a docker container (solution of this part is available in folder *app_only* in [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/szitnik/docker-itds)).

We have a simple Python web server implementation (*server.py*)

```python
from flask import Flask
from flask import json
from flask import request
from flask import Response

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/', methods=['GET'])
def index():     
    content = open("index.html").read()
    return Response(content, mimetype="text/html")

if __name__ == '__main__':    
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8787)
```

and accompanying HTML web template (*index.html*)

```html

```

To run the application above, install Flask library in your Python 3 environment and run the server as `python server.py`:

```bash
 * Serving Flask app "server" (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: off
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:8787/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

Your web application is now accessible at [http://localhost:8787](http://localhost:8787). It is a simple JS-based we page, where you can add new employees into a local JS list.

#### Dockerfiles

To define a container and be able to create an image, we must write a special file, called *Dockerfile*. Dockerfile defines what goes on in the environment inside your container. Access to resources like networking interfaces and disk drives is virtualized inside this environment, which is isolated from the rest of your system, so you need to map ports to the outside world, and be specific about what files you want to "copy in" to that environment. After doing that, you can expect that the build of your application defined in this Dockerfile behaves exactly the same wherever it runs.

Let's create a file, named *Dockerfile* with the following content:

```docker
# Use an official Ubuntu runtime as a parent image
FROM ubuntu:18.04

# Set the current working directory to /work
WORKDIR /work

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /work
ADD ./ .

# Install and configure your environment
RUN apt-get update \
    && apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip \
    && pip3 install flask

# Make port 8787 available to the world outside this container (i.e. docker world)
EXPOSE 8787

# Run server.py when the container launches
ENTRYPOINT python3 server.py
```

A full list of Dockerfile commands is described at [the official Dockerfile documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/). 

If there is a need to prepare some specifics in the environment, it can be tedious to manually write all the *RUN* commands and check whether the application runs as expected. We can therefore always directly run the parent image and enter it's shell to manually prepare the environment. We then copy the working commands into a Dockerfile and build our image. To create a container from a specific image and access it's shell, run the following command: `docker run -it ubuntu:18.04 /bin/bash`.

#### Adding everything together

Now we have the files *server.py*, *index.html* and *Dockerfile* in the same folder. If we move to the same folder, we can build a Docker image named *docker-app* using the following command `docker build -t docker-app .`:

```bash
Sending build context to Docker daemon  9.728kB
Step 1/6 : FROM ubuntu:18.04
 ---> 4c108a37151f

....

Successfully built 4b727c80cf90
Successfully tagged docker-app:latest
```

Now the image is available in our Docker system (verify that using *docker image* command as we did above). To create a running container based on our image, run `docker run -p 8787:8787 docker-app`:

```bash
 * Serving Flask app "server" (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: off
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:8787/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

With this command we also map host's port 8787 to Docker container's port 8787. For additional options of *docker run* command, see [the official reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/). Our web application is now accessible at the same address as before, but is now running in a Docker container, congratulations!

Sometimes we would still like to directly access shell of a running Docker container and check something (another option would be to install an ssh server into container and map a port to the host). First we need to get the id of our container using command `docker ps` and then execute `docker exec -it CONTAINER_ID /bin/bash`. Now we are connected directly to the "machine" that hosts our web application. If our running application generates logs, we can easily access them using `docker logs CONTAINER_ID`.

### Volumes

By default all files created inside a container are stored on a writable container layer. The main points to notice here are:

* The data doesnâ€™t persist when that container no longer exists, and it can be difficult to get the data out of the container if another process needs it.
* A containerâ€™s writable layer is tightly coupled to the host machine where the container is running. You canâ€™t easily move the data somewhere else.
* Writing into a containerâ€™s writable layer requires a storage driver to manage the filesystem. The storage driver provides a union filesystem, using the Linux kernel. This extra abstraction reduces performance as compared to using data volumes, which write directly to the host filesystem.

As a result, best practices are to always create containers read-only. Docker thus provides two solutions to store files, which are persisted also after the container removal - volumes and bind mounts. [Volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) are the best way to persist data in Docker.

Commands to manage Docker volumes start with `docker volume` (add *--help* parameter to list all options). After the volume is created, we can map it to a specific mount point when running the container (see [docker run command reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/) for more).

### Docker application example with multiple services

When developing an application that consist of multiple services, we can also create one "fat" container hosting all the services. This is not the Docker best practice as therefore each service should be run within a separate Docker container.

Let's upgrade our web application and add database support to it (solution of this part is available in folder *app_and_database* in [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/szitnik/docker-itds)). 

#### Web application service

Web application service is similar to the example above. The differences are installation of an additional *mysql-connector-python* library into the container (*Dockerfile*), implementation of REST calls to the backend (*index.html*) and server endpoints implementation (*server.py*).

In the implementation we should notice the connection settings from the application to the database. As we said, both services will run separately in a Docker container, so we should provide a connection between them. When we run the services, we should name the containers and create a network among running services. Connection settings look like as follows:

```python
config = {
  'user': 'root',
  'password': 'BeReSeMi.DataScience',
  'host': 'database',
  'database': 'data_science',
  'raise_on_warnings': False
}
```

We should notice the *host* setting and by default, port 3306 is used to connect to a MySQL database. In the MySQL container, that port will also needed to be exposed within the Dockerfile. Docker services can be connected using separate *virtual networks* and by default, *bridge networks* are created to interconnect running containers. For more sophisticated examples, see [the official network setting guidelines](https://docs.docker.com/network/).

#### Database service

For the database service, we will use already created image, which is available from [the public MySQL image repository](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql) (for more info on repositories, see section \@ref(registries)). Along with the image, there are also instructions of how to use it with the parameters, where to put initial script files, ... to ease the deployment process without creating complicated Dockerfiles.

In our case, the database dockerfile looks as follows:

```
# Parent image
FROM mysql:5

# Copying all files in curent dir to container
ADD ./ /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d

# Updating permissions for the copied files
RUN /bin/bash -c 'chmod a+rx /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/*'
```

We observe that only thing we did is just copying files into a special folder in the container (*/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d*) which was previously set as init folder, where all the *.sql* scripts are run at startup. 

To test our Dockerfile, we can also run it separately using the command (from the *database* folder) `docker build -t docker-db . && docker run -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=BeReSeMi docker-db`. We set the database password of the root user using an environment variable, which can be used to connect to the database. Now we can connect to the database from the host machine - e.g. use [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) and connection settings to *localhost:3306*. If everything is okay, a database named *data_science* should be created along with the *employees* table and few entries in it.


#### Docker compose

Congratulations! Now you know how to create docker containers separately. We just need to glue them together and run them more easily. Docker compose is the easiest tool to help us out.

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It uses YAML files to configure the application's services and performs the creation and start-up process of all the containers with a single command. The docker-compose CLI utility allows you to run commands on multiple containers at once, for example, building images, scaling containers, running containers that were stopped, and more. The docker-compose.yml file is used to define an application's services and includes various configuration options. 

Before continuing, stop all running containers and move to the `app_and_database` folder. First, let's check the *docker-compose.yml* file: 

```
version: '3.7'

services:

  database:
    image: database
    build: ./database
    command: --default-authentication-plugin=mysql_native_password
    restart: always
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: BeReSeMi.DataScience
    ports:
      - 3306:3306
    volumes:
      - ds_databases:/var/lib/mysql
    networks:

In the *docker-compose* configuration we define two containers, one named *database* and other *application*. Parameter *build* defines the folder with an appropriate Dockerfile or directly an already built image name. Parameter *restart* instructs the container to automaticallt restart its service if is suddenly stopped (due to crash, error, ...). Parameter *depends_on* created dependencies between containers, so the application container will be started after the database container is running (tip: be aware that this is based on the time when service is beginning to start, so if database script initialization takes long time, database service may be running later than the application service). With the volumes parameter we map a specific folder in the container to a named volume *db_databases* - this folder will contain the database data. We also define a network named *dsnet* with the bridge configuration and therefore both containers will be able to communicate with each other.

To run the *docker-compose* configuration, run `docker-compose up` (for detached mode add parameter *-d* at the end). Both containers should be created and running - to verify, navigate to [http://localhost:8787](http://localhost:8787) and add some employees. Data should be persistent and stored into the database.

To shut down the containers, press CTRL+C (or run `docker-compose down` if you started containers in a detached mode).

#### Image registries {#registries}

We have already mentioned that there exist already prepared images, which can be retried from the public repositories. Repositories can be public or private. Two main public registries are [Docker Hub](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub) and Docker Cloud. Docker Hub is the default registry where Docker looks for images. Docker clients connect to Docker repositories to download (*pull*) images for use or upload (*push*) images that they have built. 

We have published the image of the first example in the repository *szitnik/docker-ds-app* ([link](https://hub.docker.com/r/szitnik/docker-ds-app)). You can pull the image (*docker pull* command) or run it directly with the command:

```bash
docker run -p 8787:8787 szitnik/docker-ds-app
```

The functionality should be the same as with the image you created during this tutorial.

To publish images to Docker Hub, you will need first to create account and then you will be able to publish your own images. Let's say that you still have built image from the first example, named *docker-app*. You can push it to the Docker Hub using the following commands:

```bash
# Provide credentials and login
docker login

# Tag your local image
docker tag docker-app USERNAME/PUBLIC_IMAGE_NAME:TAG

# Publish your image
docker push USERNAME/PUBLIC_IMAGE_NAME:TAG
```

If you do not define the tag, it will be *latest* by default. You can access your image via Web interface at *https://hub.docker.com/r/USERNAME/PUBLIC_IMAGE_NAME*, where you can also add description, instructions, publish the *Dockerfile* or connect its content to your Git repository. Now anybody can pull & run your image using the same procedure as we did above.

## Learning outcomes

Data science students should work towards obtaining the knowledge and the skills that enable them to:

* Use an existing Docker image.
* Package and application consisting of multiple services into one or more containers and manage them.
* Publish reproducive algorithms to Docker Hub.
* Use and extend existing public Docker images.

## Practice problems

* Create a simple Python program or web application, write a Dockerfile to compile an image an publish it on Docker Hub. If you are more proficient with some other language, use a framework of your choice.
* Write a service, which needs multiple servers deployed and run everything using docker compose. Dockerize your Introduction to Data Science project and publish it to Docke Hub. Add instructions of how to use your image.
